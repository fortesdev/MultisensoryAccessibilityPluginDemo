# How to:

Clone this project as well as the Plugin linked above.
Copy the Plugin content into the "Plugins" folder of the demo.
Double click the the demo's uproject file.

**Important note:** This is not the demo shown in the video (which takes up to 3+ Gb including assets). This is simply the first person UE example with the plugin included, showcasing on how to invoke its methods (a few are functional - check the map's blueprint to see them, and the keys that triggers them).
